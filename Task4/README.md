# Task 4: Reinforcement Learning



**Task description**

Your task is to control a lunar lander in a smooth descent to the ground. It must land in-between two flags, quickly, using minimal fuel, and without damaging the lander. Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm that, by practicing on a simulator, learns a control policy for the lander.
